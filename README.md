# PostsSiteDjango
 **Site built with Django Framework and Django REST Framework.**
 
 
**My big learning project.**

The site was written according to the Django course. All code is typed by me, nothing is copied. Also in this project there is an implementation of a RESTful application.
This Django application is a site with posts, adding them, authorizing and registering. Implemented REST API for post transmission.


In addition to the site, TGBot has been developed to send posts. Only an authorized user has permission to send posts.


The application has 3 models: Women (post model), Category (post category model), Profile (model for storing information about a telegram subscriber, his id, name and username)

**IDE:** PyCharm Professional

**DBMS (СУБД):** SQLite

**Frameworks:** Django 4.1.6, Django REST Framework 3.14.0

**Python interpreter version:** 3.11
